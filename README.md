# Holiday Cost Calculator

## Description
The **Holiday Cost Calculator** is a Python script (`holiday.py`)
designed to help users budget their travel expenses by calculating the total cost of a holiday.
It takes user inputs for the flight destination (Durban, Cape Town, or Johannesburg),
the number of nights for a hotel stay, and the number of days for a car rental.
The script computes costs based on fixed rates: flights (1500–3000 Rand depending on the city),
hotel stays (2500 Rand per night), and car rentals (1000 Rand per day), then sums them to provide the total holiday cost.

This project is important for travelers who want a quick and easy way to estimate holiday expenses,
ensuring better financial planning. It’s particularly useful for South African travelers planning trips to major cities,
as it provides a straightforward tool to compare costs across destinations.
